<h1>Why is it Bad?</h1>
<h2>1. The website itself isn't very colorful and looks like a blank browser</h2>
<h2>2. It is also hard to recognize, and it isn't clear what the site is meant to do at first glance</h2>
<h2>3. You need to scroll a lot before finding key parts of the page</h2>
<h2>4. What is and isn't a button isn't clear</h2>
  
<h1>In the Video</h1>
<h2>For almost every submission, the user has very little control over what they are trying to do</h2>
<h2>Even if the user CAN control what they're doing, it often requires knowledge or skill that not everyone will have</h2>
<h2>Ones that are straight-forward are tedious to use, and often need important information</h2>
<h2>Not accessable to all devices (devices that don't have a gyroscope or arrow keys)</h2>
<h2>Then there's the username one. That one is just silly; it could theoretically be used effectively</h2>
