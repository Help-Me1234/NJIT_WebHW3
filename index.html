<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Sol. I have 2 cats named Thomas and Hamilton, and I enjoy worldbuilding. Currently, I'm working on multiple writing projects that involve fantasy/sci-fi worlds; I enjoy putting what I learned into my stories</p>
<p>I am a freshman student working on an Internet technology degree.</p>
